One really cool thing about Monte Carlo is as you increase \
the total number of points you use in your simulation, the more accurate your results. \
This actually relies on a basic principle of statistics called 'The Law of Large Numbers' \
([you can learn more about it in the first 2 minutes of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MntX3zWNWec)).

In practice this means that a graph like this one, that tracks your calculated Pi value, \
against the total number of points you used in it's estimation, will show less spread \
as the total number of points increases. In math/statistics we call this convergence.

In this case the number we converge on is the true value of Pi (I have added it as a \
red horizantal line on the graph). Notice how spread out the estimations are \
at low orders of magnitude (small numbers such as 1, 10 or 100) and how at large \
estimations (1000 or more) you can barely distinguish individual points!""")
